<!--Active galactic nuclei-->
<div class="desc" id="descAGN" style="display: none;">
<h2 class="desc">Flares from active galactic nuclei</h2>
<p class="desc">Blazars are active galactic nuclei, which harbor a relativistic jet oriented towards (or nearly) the line of sight. </p>
<p class="desc"> They are classified as BL Lacertae (BL Lacs) or Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), depending on their spectral features. </p>
<p class="desc"> Blazar flares are extensively studied in the literature through the modeling of their multi-wavelength and multi-messenger emissions. These models require a significant number of parameters, and therefore focus on specific sources with high quality multi-wavelength and multi-messenger data, in order to break degeneracies in the parameter space (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04275">Gao et al. 2018</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04537">Keivani et al. 2018</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04010">Petropoulou et al. 2019</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02006">Oikonomou et al. 2019</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10190">Xue et al. 2019</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03681">Xue et al. 2020</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07218">Petropoulou et al. 2020</a>). The models usually predict steady state spectra during the flare, potentially compared with quiescent spectra. </p>
</div>

<!--Gamma-ray bursts-->
<div class="desc" id="descGRB" style="display: none;">
<h2 class="desc">Gamma-ray bursts</h2>
<p class="desc"> Gamma-ray bursts (GRB) encompass various categories, involving different progenitors and source environments, and can be associated with successful to fully chocked jets, or winds, with numerous promising sites for HE-UHE neutrino production, such as internal shocks, or jet-cocoon interaction sites. Populations of sources hidden in terms of EM radiation could provide a significant contribution to the diffuse HE neutrino flux.</p>

<p class="desc"> <b> Long GRBs. </b> Supernovae and hypernovae are closely connected to long GRBs and low-luminosity GRBs (LL GRBs) \cite{Hjorth:2011zx}. Long GRBs are the most luminous sources of EM radiation of the Universe, produced by the core collapse of super-massive stars. Their precursor and prompt phases are dominated by gamma rays, whereas their afterglow is dominated by radio and X-ray emissions. Their production of HE to UHE neutrinos during these different phases has been extensively studied \cite{Waxman:1997ti, Dermer:2000yd, Murase:2006dr, Murase:2007yt, Murase:2008mr, Meszaros:2015krr, Globus15}, and depends strongly on the production sites \cite{Pitik:2021xhb}. Correlations with GeV-TeV neutrinos could help constrain GRB emission mechanisms \cite{Murase:2013hh}. The detection of VHE emissions during GRB afterglows, for instance GRB 180720B or GRB 190114C \cite{Abdalla:2019dlr, MAGIC:2019lau} challenges emission models and opens the possibility of an hadronic component required to explain the light curve.</p>

<p class="desc"> <b> Low luminosity and choked GRBs. </b> LL GRBs have been suggested as a separate population from high-luminosity GRBs, due to their longer variability timescales, lower luminosities and break energies, and possibly lower Lorentz factors \cite{Virgili09, Bromberg11}. Unified models consider off-axis or semi-chocked jets \cite{Nakar15, Salafia16}. However, off-axis models tend to be inconsistent with observations due to the lack of a bright afterglow. HE neutrino production is studied in the context of trans-relativistic shock breakout models or weak jets, with fully or partially choked jets depending on the properties of the progenitor \cite{Kashiyama13, Senno:2015tsn, Boncioli:2018lrv, Fasano:2021bwq}.</p>

<p class="desc"> <b> Short GRBs and neutron star mergers. </b> Short GRBs belong to a separate class of transient events, linked to compact-object binary mergers. The well known NS-NS merger GW170817/GRB-170817A has been detected in GW and across the full EM spectrum. Existing scenarios for the production of HE-UHE cosmic rays and neutrinos in short GRBs include for instance the production of a magnetar by the NS-NS merger \cite{Piro:2016jaq, Fang:2017tla}, or structured jets interacting with the merger ejecta \cite{Kimura:2018vvz, Gottlieb:2021pzr}. The production of transient HE neutrino signals from NS-NS merger remnants has also been studied \cite{Decoene:2019eux}.</p>

<!--Tidal disruption events-->
<div class="desc" id="descTDE" style="display: none;">
<h2 class="desc">Tidal disruptions by massive black holes</h2>
<p class="desc">Tidal disruptions of stars by massive black holes (TDE, for Tidal Disruption Event) have been observed in the UV, X-rays and $\gamma$ rays \cite{Komossa15}, and can produce luminous and long-lasting flares, sometimes associated with relativistic jets \cite{Bloom2011, Burrows2011}. HE-VHE neutrino production in TDE jets has been extensively studied \cite{Murase08a, MT09, Wang11, Wang16, Senno16b, Dai16, Lunardini16, Biehl:2017hnb, Guepin:2017abw, Winter:2020ptf}, as well as models involving non-relativistic outflows and off-axis jets \cite{Hayasaki:2019kjy, Murase:2020lnu, Liu:2020isi}, further motivated by the hint of association between AT2019dsg and IC191001A \cite{Stein20}. A few of these models account for possible acceleration and interactions of cosmic-ray nuclei \cite{Biehl:2017hnb, Guepin:2017abw}, or account for time-dependent modeling \cite{Guepin:2017abw, Hayasaki:2019kjy}.</p>
</div>

<!--Supernovae-->
<div class="desc" id="descSNe" style="display: none;">
<h2 class="desc">Supernovae</h2>
<p class="desc">The production of HE to UHE neutrino from novae, thermonuclear or core-collapse supernovae and hypernovae has been extensively studied. It is closely related with HE to UHE neutrino production from pulsars \cite{Beall02} and magnetars, as supernovae and hypernovae can be driven by pulsars or magnetars. These populations of sources can produce Galactic or extra-galactic transient neutrino emissions. These compact objects have been suggested as potential VHE-UHE cosmic-ray sources, e.g. \cite{Arons03, Fang12, Kotera15, Guepin:2019fjb}. Many studies focus on modeling their quiescent emissions, and mostly hadronic interactions, due to the dense hadronic backgrounds. However, transient HE neutrino emissions can be produced through interactions with non-thermal, thermal or baryonic fields of the ejecta. A precise modeling of HE neutrino light-curve can help to identify transient or time-dependent emissions from these sources \cite{Murase:2009pg, Fang16, Murase:2017pfe, Fang:2020bkm}. </p>
</div>

<!--Neutron stars-->
<div class="desc" id="descNS" style="display: none;">
<h2 class="desc">Neutron stars</h2>
<p class="desc">Young pulsars or magnetars with millisecond periods could produce transient emissions associated with the short characteristic timescales of their rotation
energy losses. Interaction with radiation backgrounds inside the pulsar magnetosphere could also lead to transient HE-UHE neutrino emissions. In existing
magnetar models, protons extracted from the surface of young magnetars can be accelerated to ultra-high energies, and interact with the high X-ray
background close to the surface or the surrounding baryonic background, potentially enhanced during/after bursts and flares [Zhang:2002xv, Ioka:2005er]. </p>

<!--Compact object mergers-->
<div class="desc" id="descCOM" style="display: none;">
<h2 class="desc">Compact object mergers</h2>
<p class="desc">Gravitational wave detections by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations have raised the interest for compact object mergers, mainly black hole (BH-BH) mergers,
but also black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) mergers, and neutron star mergers previously mentioned. The existence of EM and MM counterparts to BH-BH or
BH-NS has been proposed [Murase:2016etc, Kotera:2016dmp, deVries:2016ljw], for instance with the Blandford-Znajek process generating an outflow.
White dwarf mergers have also been proposed as a source of high-energy neutrinos [Xiao:2016man], with a potentially optically thick debris disk hiding
HE photons from the observer.</p>

<!--X-ray binaries-->
<div class="desc" id="descXRB" style="display: none;">
<h2 class="desc">X-ray binaries</h2>
<p class="desc">Closely related sources are X-ray binaries (XRB), composed of a neutron star or a black hole and a companion star. These sources are bright in X-rays
and sometimes gamma rays, and can present winds or collimated beams (mircoquasars). XRBs are interesting prospective Galactic sources for cosmic-
ray acceleration and HE neutrino production [Levinson:2001as, Anchordoqui:2002xu, Distefano:2002qw, Baerwald:2012yd, Sahakyan:2013opa].
Existing models consider photohadronic but also purely hadronc interactions. Moreover, they mostly focus on diffuse emissions, and predict neutrino signals
principally below the HE range. Nevertheless, transient neutrino signals could be produced in coincidence with their periodic emissions and outbursts.</p>
